# Santa’s Sleigh Optimization  
### An Integrated Machine Learning Framework for Large-Scale Logistics Optimization

## Overview

This project presents a machine learning framework designed to optimize large-scale logistical routing under dynamic environmental and operational constraints. The system integrates clustering, time-series reasoning, and classification modeling to simulate intelligent delivery optimization.

The project was developed as part of the Christmas Data Mining & ML Challenge.

## Problem Statement

Efficient large-scale logistics require:

- Spatial clustering of delivery zones
- Forecasting demand variations
- Handling imbalanced operational events
- Balancing ethical and environmental constraints

This project builds an integrated ML pipeline to address these challenges.
